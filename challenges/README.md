# Welcome
The challanges area of the repository contains different small challenges in different programming languages.
I give myself a challenge that I want to fullfill, however the challenge should have a few criteria. 
1. It should be usefull
2. It should be programmed in a programming language of which I do not have extensive knowledge
3. It should have some limit such as 100 lines only, run in a certain time or be created within a time frame

Those challenges help me hone my skills and allows me to explore programming languages extensively,
furthermore it forces me to apply best practises of different programming languages.
